I need a python program that scrapes product review data from marksandspencer.com.

I want to be able to run from the commandline:

python m_and_s_scraper.py infile outfile

infile will be a text file containing product_category_urls eg:
http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/coats-and-jackets/

outfile will specify the location of the csv to writeback.
there should be one row written per review, containing all the fields returned by the
product_review_scraper function detailed below.

Below I sketch out the two main functions required in this implementation:
def products_in_category_iterator(product_category_url):
    '''
    Iterator over product urls for all products in a category
    Args:     Product_category_url : url that points to a product category eg ‘http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/coats-and-jackets/’
    Yields:
        product_url
    '''
    
    
def product_review_scraper(product_url):
    '''
    Iterator over reviews for a particular product
    Args:
        product_url string containing product url eg.
    
    Yields:
        review dict containing the following fields: {OverallScore:int, Quality:int, ValueForMoney:int,
                                                    Fit:int, Style:int, HowDoesItFit:string, ReviewText:string,

                                                    ReviewTitle:string, ReviewDate:string,
                                                    ReviewerAge:int, ReviewerFrom:string, ProductName:string,
                                                    ProductCode:string}
    '''
