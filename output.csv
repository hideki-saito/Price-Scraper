Not sure about wearing with a skirt but when the weather warms up a bit, this garment will come into its own - will look smart over tailored trousers and blouse with maybe a scarf to brighten the outfit up.

I am an average height at 5 ft 7 in but this only came down to mid calf on me so not what I would describe as longline. The fabric was very synthetic in quality and I could not detect any of the added stretch. I was hoping for a jersey sleeveless jacket of a much longer length.

Water Resistant Mac with Stormwear™,T621206L,5,5,5,5,5,True to size,Saw this jacket in store few weeks ago and loved the colour and feel of the jacket but thought it slightly expensive. Decided to buy yesterday with £20 offer given to me. Am size 14 in m and s t shirts but size 16 in some of their jackets. Tried both sizes and found that size 14 looked better on me as size 16 looked baggy . The side ties are loose on me at size 14 but pulled in at size 16. Agree that ties pulled in suit taller summer people than me too. Another reviewer said how uplifting the feel and colour of jacket s and it's true.

The green is very dark and will go well with this summers fashion but will also be wearable into autumn. However for me the jacket doesn't have the &quot;wow&quot; effect. I don't find that it is particularly well cut. It looks ok when it is done up but doesn't sit quite right, it shows a few creases. In my opinion it isn't fitted enough.

Elizabeth Linen Longline Coat,T913252,5,5,5,4,5,A bit big,the colour is not as pink as the photo. It's more pale peach- basically same colour as the tie blouse in this range- which put me off at first as I liked the brighter pink in the photo. However it is a lovely quality coat - not only fabulous quality linen but beautifully finished with good attention to detail. It is cut loose so if you want a close-fitted style you'd need to go a size down. I think it makes a great quality statement coat and hope to get lots of wear from it - weather permitting!,lovely quality modern coat; not quite pink,19 February 2016,55-64,"Somerset, UK"

It has a drawstring which defines the waist and I like the cheerful pattern. I was particularly impressed that it is made using recycled materials. I will definitely by another in a different design.,"Handy, featherweight and showerproof.",14 April 2016,55-64,"Northampton, Northampton, UK"
Floral Parka with Stormwear™,T493705,2,3,5,2,2,True to size,Loved the fabric and the print of this jacket but it is really let down by the drawstring ties being on the outside. If you want to pull the waist in you are left with the ties hanging down the front. Why could they not have been in the inside and therefore concealed ? The price is good but would rather have paid a bit more for a better finish.,Horrible ties,13 April 2016,55-64,Nottingham

Piqué Jacket,T590853J,4,4,4,2,4,A bit small,This is a lovely jacket but it is a small fit for me - tight around the shoulders. A smaller person should be ok although I did buy my normal size. I'm still looking for a traditional blazer though.
